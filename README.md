### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

```bash
aMediocreDad@Github> I am the maintainer of forbidden-lands-foundry-vtt over at fvtt-fria-ligan. 
We are a group of developers who enjoy Free League Publishing games,
and work on letting you play them on Foundry VTT.
```

I am active on the Foundry VTT discord and try to help users with any questions they have in regards to the implementation of the Forbidden Lands system or the official modules which I developed together with Free League Publishing:sparkles:

At the moment I am a student, dad, full-time employee and VP of a startup. I also do the stuff above when I can find the time.
